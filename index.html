      <p>Born in American Fork, Utah in February 1989. The weather outside was cold, like it normally is for February in Utah. But our young hero didn't understand this, he had barely begun his cognitive development. For that he would need to go to school. He would gain this education from Utah Valley University before realizing that might not be enough and attending Code Fellows.</p>
      <p>As far as job experience, Jacob spent a decade perfecting his craft as a molecular biologist before thinking better of working with test tubes. They don't tell you this in university but test tubes have a poor sense of humor, and laughing to oneself in a lab in full protective gear gives off mad-scientist vibes that did't fit Jacob's style. Once he came to this understanding he dedicated himself to the dark arts of programming; pouring over spell books late into the night chanting recursive function incantations to summon user input from the neith world of the wide web.</p>
