      <h2 id = "shortHistory">A Short History</h2>
      <p>Born in American Fork, Utah in February 1989. The weather outside was cold, like it normally is for February in Utah. But our young hero didn't understand this, he had barely begun his cognitive development. For that he would need to go to school. He would gain this education from Utah Valley University before realizing that might not be enough and attending Code Fellows.</p>
